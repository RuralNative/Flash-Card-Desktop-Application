**LESSON 1**
    The JavaFX Stage is the equivalent of Swing JFrame. It shall serve as the main container for the GUI of the Java application. Meanwhile the JavaFX Scene decorates the Stage for the application. So to create a GUI, a Stage has to be instantiated for the sole purpose of holding the different graphical components of the application's user interface.     
    What about the Group? The Group is the set of nodes of graphical components that is responsible for the actual design of the Scene, which in turn designs the Stage. In my understanding, this meant that every component I might create from the libraries available from JavaFX are basically nodes of that composes a Group object.
